{
  "topic": "Quasars",
  "summary": "Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are extremely luminous objects found in the centers of some galaxies. They are among the brightest objects in the universe, emitting vast amounts of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. This energy is produced by supermassive black holes that are actively consuming surrounding gas and dust. As material falls into the black hole, it forms an accretion disk, which heats up and releases enormous amounts of energy. Quasars are typically located billions of light-years away, making them valuable tools for studying the early universe and the evolution of galaxies.",
